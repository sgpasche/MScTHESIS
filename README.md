Short description
Several glaciers in Switzerland are unstable, causing regular break-offs of ice avalanches. These are a threat to alpine communities, as they have killed many in the past and caused significant damage. We have installed seismometers on such glaciers, which measure the seismic waves travelling through the ice and are caused by icequakes, earthquakes and other processes. We aim to develop monitoring methods in order to better understand the physical processes in the ice before a break-off event. The idea of this project is to classify and characterize the icequakes of unstable glaciers, for example to explore the temporal distribution of different icequake types and to find repeating events in the large catalog of events (1000s of icequakes per day). The expected goal of this project is to program a code that can efficiently process large seismic datasets and detect and classify icequakes of various kinds. The developed code can then be applied to existing data from unstable glaciers (e.g. Bisgletscher, Eiger-Westflanke) and interpreted in terms of glaciological processes.
